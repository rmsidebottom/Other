My vimrc and some miscellaneous files

Feel free to use any of these. If you have any tips or improvements, 
please inform me!

If any files require information from outside sources, I will not include
those extra files in my GitHub unless there are mine. I will do my best
to point you in the proper direction so that you can easily find the 
necessary files to make your file work.

VIMRC INFORMATION
  GitHub does not allow me to upload hidden files, therefore you will need
  to rename the vimrc to .vimrc in order for it to work. In addition, place
  the file in your home directory (which can be navigated to by entering 
  "cd"). Once both of those steps are complete (and you included any extra
  files needed in their proper directory) restart vim (close and reopen a 
  file) and you will see the changes.
  
  Currently, my vimrc does require an extra set of files. Since I use the 
  luna color scheme, you will need to download those files into the .vim/colors
  directory. This will allow you to use the color scheme and vim won't 
  complain about it.
